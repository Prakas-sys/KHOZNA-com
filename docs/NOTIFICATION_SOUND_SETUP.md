# Download Notification Sound

Since we can't download directly via curl in PowerShell, please download a notification sound manually:

## Option 1: Free Sound Libraries
1. Go to: https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/notification/
2. Download any notification sound you like
3. Save it as `notification.mp3` in the `public/` folder

## Option 2: Quick Download Link
1. Right-click this link: https://assets.mixkit.co/active_storage/sfx/2869/2869.wav
2. Select "Save Link As..."
3. Save as `notification.mp3` in the `/public` folder

## Option 3: Use Any MP3
- You can use any short notification sound (MP3 format)
- Keep it under 1 second for best results
- Place it in `/public/notification.mp3`

The chat will work without the sound, it just won't play audio notifications.
